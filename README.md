## Description

In another repo, I created a [repo](https://github.com/SThornewillvE/Pet-Project---Python-Linear-Solver) for how to use linear programming in python.

I will need to give a talk at a data science meetup at the end of august and I wanted to show a real world application of linear programming. One of the most stereotypical examples of linear programming is creating a diet plan.

Since I have been doing body building as a vegan, creating a good diet is pretty important for me and so I thought that this project would be interesting, fun and can help spread awareness of nutrition of a whole foods plant based diet.

## Steps

In order to create this project, I will need to collect and organise the following data.

1. What sort of foods do I buy on a weekly basis and for how much?
2. What other foods havent I included but can also be put into the analysis?
3. What kind of nutrition can be found within each food?
4. What are my targets (constraints) for the diet?

## Guiding Questions

While doing this project I don't want to create the perfect diet but to create an outline to give me an idea of the kind of proportions I should be eating and how that should change based on my nutrition goals.

1. What kinds of foods are rich in proteins that I should focus on?
2. Although fats should be controlled, they are still important. What is the best way to keep them under control?
3. What are cost intensive foods that I should pay attention to?

## File Descriptions

  * `.research/` - contains files containing sources that I will use to understand my requirements.
  * `.dat/` - contains files that have data for the analysis or contains output of analysis.
  * `.img/` - holds any plots that I might make.
  * Python files will be created in the local directory. Notebook files are for experimentation and pototyping. Actual `.py` files will be anything that I want as a package instead of an interactive notebook.
